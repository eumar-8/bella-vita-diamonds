        <div class= "container-fluid text">The 4 C’s, known as the characteristics to determine the quality of your diamond, define together the unique aspect of each diamond. Therefore it’s important to understand these features. The quality of diamonds is translated in the 4 C's: Carat, Colour, Clarity, Cut <br><br> 

          These characteristics give an idea of the quality of a diamond and are used to identify them.

  <!--SECTION 2-->
  <div class="section-gray">
    <div class="text-center title">CARAT</div>
    <div class="container  text-center text">The weight and size of a stone are expressed in carat. 1 carat is 0,2 gram and divided into 100 points (or 200 milligram). This scale is very precise in determining a stone's weight and is rounded up to two decimals.<br><br>

      The correlation between carat weight and diamond value can be surprising. The higher the carat weight, the more unique and the higher priced. That’s the reason why a 2 ct diamond has not twice, but the triple value compared to a 1 Ct diamond.<br><br>

      Finally, the carat of a diamond has also a symbolic meaning. While the visual difference between a 0.98 Ct and a 1.01 Ct diamond is hardly visible, the price of the 1.01 Ct will be noticeably higher. We can explain this price difference by the fact that some weights are considered as 'magic sizes': e.g. 1.00 Ct, 1.50 Ct.

  <!--SECTION 3-->

    <div class="text-center title-gray "> COLOUR</div>
    <div class="container text-center text">The colour of a white diamond stone is determined thanks to an internationally recognized colour pallet. Colours are graduated from D, which is colourless and the most searched for, to Z, the yellowest. <br><br>

      Diamonds can also be brown, orange, pink or blue... The most intense colour shades are named 'fancy' and this is mentioned on their certificate. These coloured diamonds are extremely rare and therefore very precious, but also more speculative. Our experts noticed that the market becomes remarkably smaller for reselling a very rare diamond (colorful, very large, fancy shapes). It requires more time to resell such diamonds at a desirable price.<br><br>

      Finally, the carat of a diamond has also a symbolic meaning. While the visual difference between a 0.98 Ct and a 1.01 Ct diamond is hardly visible, the price of the 1.01 Ct will be noticeably higher. We can explain this price difference by the fact that some weights are considered as 'magic sizes': e.g. 1.00 Ct, 1.50 Ct.

  <!--SECTION 4-->
  <div class="section-gray">
    <div class="text-center title "> CLARITY</div>
    <div class="container text-center text">Most diamonds are born with birth marks, known as inclusions. The fewer flaws are present, the more light can shine through the diamond, and the better it will sparkle.<br><br>

      The clarity of the diamond can be flawed in two ways:<br>
      · External impurities: the blemishes occur during the cutting process or are due to wear.<br>
      · Internal impurities: these inclusions relate to any flaws within the stone.<br><br>

      Most common inclusions are:<br>
      · Black or dark spots -  Originate in the coal.<br>
      · Clouds - Microscopic veils which weaken the clarity.<br>
      · Feathers - Most impurities in diamonds come out of the molecular break during the creation process.

  <!--SECTION 5-->
  <div>
    <div class="text-center title-gray">CUT</div>
    <div class="container text-center text">Cut is a diamond's most important characteristic. It is the factor that fuels a diamond’s fire, sparkle and brilliance. Cut refers to a diamond’s proportions, symmetry and polish. If the depth of the diamond is too shallow or too deep it will allow light to escape through the sides or the bottom of the stone. A well-cut diamond will direct almost all the light through the crown.<br><br>

      The term 'cut' can also describe the shape of a diamond. Other shapes than the standard round brilliant cut are called fancy cuts. The most known are the marquise, pear, oval, heart and emerald cut.
